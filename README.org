* Node app
Since the last version of *Node*, as of today, support TS, I'll just let the IDE
handle the types and run without transpiling.
In the root of the folder:
#+begin_src bash
  nvm install 23
  npm init -y
#+end_src

Some basic settings to begin with:
- Main entry point is =index.ts=. I write directly in typescript and let *Node*
  do the stripping. I will probably have to use only a subset of the TS features
  available.
- Tests will run with the built in test runner ~node --test~.
  *Node* will run against any file that ends with =.test.ts=


Because Typescript doesn't understand *Node* types, I need to also install them.
#+name: install node types
#+begin_src bash
  npm i -D @types/node
#+end_src
* 🔑 Env
It's all done locally, so no need of handling API Keys of any sort.
